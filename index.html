      <p class="text-left">
        Our pillars of Society, Brotherhood, and Remembrance were established upon the formation of the Alpha Chapter at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, on August 16, 1996. Our founders realized the unique promise of a Greek-lettered organization that instills positive values among its members, provides an avenue for leadership, and promotes self-betterment.
      </p>

      <p class="text-left">
        In its nascent stages, these founders understood that they must maintain a constant and growing nationwide network in order to truly manifest their organizational vision. As such, several new brothers were inducted on August 22, 1998 in New York. At this time, eight men from three different universities were given the status of National Founding Fathers as they were the visionaries who established the Fraternity for years to come.
      </p>

      <p class="text-left">
        Modern day Sigma Beta Rho has grown considerably since its inception. We have expanded from our roots on the East Coast to forty five recognized active chapters and colonies that span the breadth of the nation. This growth stems from a reputation for excellent, values-based programming, diversity among our brotherhood, and alignment with the ideals of many students who strive for a competitive edge before entering a post-globalized working world.
      </p>

      <h1 class="text-center">Our History</h1>
      <p class="text-left">
        The University of Michigan colony was founded in 2012. Thirteen men had a vision to expand Sigma Beta Rho Fraternity, Inc. to the Midwest Region. These men were given the status of Founding Fathers as they would establish the fraternity for years to come. More importantly, they were the foundation for expansion throughout the entire region.

          As a fraternity that strongly believes in giving back to our community through service, we have partnered with S.O.S Children’s Villages International as our national Philanthropy. Duty to one’s society is instilled in each of our members at induction and emphasized throughout his undergraduate years. This foundation has been working with disadvantaged families around the world from more than 133 different countries since 1960 in order to prevent crises that can lead to family separation. S.O.S Children’s Villages’ focus is on abandoned, destitute and orphaned children requiring family-based child care. Millions of children worldwide are living without the biological families therefore S.O.S. provides about 50,000 such children and 15,000 young adults with a permanent new family. Community service and campus involvement is a crucial component of our chapter evaluations.

          Brotherhood defines the bonds that hold our fraternity together. Through the development of close relationships within the ranks of our fraternity, brothers of Sigma Beta Rho know that they are creating relationships that will last them for a lifetime. Brothers from Sigma Beta Rho are dedicated to each other and are always finding ways to spend time together. On campus, brothers live together, take classes together, compete in intramural sports together and participate in a variety of extracurriculars together.

          Even after graduation, brothers find ways to stay involved. Through our Chapter’s alumni network and mentorship program, on-campus brothers have the opportunity to connect with those that have already graduated, creating relationships and expanding their personal networks. Alumni from our chapter have gone on to companies like Microsoft, Goldman Sachs, NASA, J.P Morgan Chase, graduate schools while some have started their own companies, even being named to Forbes 30 under 30 for their accomplishments in entrepreneurship. These are the members of our fraternity that are always looking for ways to give back.

          Our membership is comprised of individuals from all different nationalities, ethnicities, religions, and creeds. As a truly multicultural fraternity, we are committed to promoting diversity and cultural awareness on university campuses across the nation. It has been said that the best way to realize where you are going is knowing where you have come from, and that is why we are dedicated to showcasing the different cultures that each of our members bring. Given that many come from different backgrounds, not only is it necessary for an individual to recognize and appreciate his/her own culture, but also to be aware of and to appreciate other cultures. At its core, remembrance is about understanding and appreciating what others have done for the world and taking the initiative to leave your own mark, be it in terms of service, your achievements or the bonds that you form. Brothers work to empower each other to make these changes as strong and permanent as possible.

        <h1>F.A.Q.S</h1>
      </center>

      <h5 class="text-left">
        What are the social aspects of fraternity and sorority membership?
      </h5>
      <p class="text-left">
        Just like most other student organizations, Sigma Beta Rho contributes to the social activity on campus, so our National Executive Board has worked toward the creation of a responsible and safe environment for our members. All of our chapters have strict policies regarding the consumption of alcohol by underage members and guests as well as safe consumption for those of age. All members are held accountable to their state laws.
      </p>

      <h5 class="text-left">
        What is the financial obligation?
      </h5>
      <p class="text-left">
        Like some opportunities for involvement in college there is a financial commitment associated with a joining a fraternity or sorority. The costs go toward the Inter/National fees, chapter operating expenses, and social functions. Financial obligations differ among individual chapters, as well as living in or out of a chapter house. Typically, these consist of chapter dues, national dues, and philanthropy dues. We understand the strain these unexpected expenses can cause on students and/or parents so we offer many type of fundraising opportunities to help.
      </p>

      <h5 class="text-left">
        Is hazing a part of the Sigma Beta Rho culture?
      </h5>
      <p class="text-left">
        Sigma Beta Rho has a zero-tolerance policy regarding hazing that is consistent with anti-hazing legislation. Our New Member Education Process is created solely to educate incoming members about the fraternity, how to be a successful member, and get the most out of their collegiate experience and fraternal membership. If you sense your son may be participating in inappropriate activities as a result of membership, please contact our National Office. All correspondences will be handled in an immediate and discreet manner.
      </p>

      <h5 class="text-left">
        Who is actually in charge of the fraternity?
      </h5>
      <p class="text-left">
        We have an elected National Executive Board and regional officers that oversee the operations of the organization at every school. Individual chapters elect officers to manage the day-to-day operations of the organization. These officers are assisted by alumni who act as advisors. Each chapter is responsible to report with our National office. We offer support, advice, and direction through professional and experienced staff/volunteers. Also, at each individual chapter, Greek Coordinators are on staff and serve as the primary contacts for the Greek community.
      </p>

      <h5 class="text-left">
        What is Rush/Recruitment/Intake?
      </h5>
      <p class="text-left">
        Greek organizations practice what is called either Recruitment or Intake. There are two forms of recruitment, formal and informal. Formal recruitment consists of a “Rush Week” where each chapter will host a series of events for potential new members. The formal process allows your son to experience the brotherhood and various activities we engage in. However, throughout the remainder of the calendar year, all young men will have the opportunity to meet and interact with our fraternity members (informal recruitment). The Membership Intake process to join occurs at various times throughout the year at the discretion of each chapter, in accordance with university policies, rules, and regulations.
      </p>

      <h5 class="text-left">
        What is pledging?
      </h5>
      <p class="text-left">
        All fraternity members experience a period of orientation. During this time, your son and other new members will participate in weekly meetings to learn about the university and the fraternity history, leadership retreats, community service projects, and activities designed to build friendships among new members (pledges/associates/candidates) and the initiated members. SIGMA BETA RHO POLICIES FORBID HAZING, and are committed to a membership education period that instills a sense of responsibility and commitment in our new members. This period will assist your student in overcoming some of the concerns about success in college.
      </p>

      <h5 class="text-left">
        What is a philanthropy or service project?
      </h5>
      <p class="text-left">
        All Sigma Beta Rho members take it as part of their mission to support our national philanthropy (SOS Children’s Villages) financially and physically. Throughout the year, each chapter spends time fundraising and volunteering to help the philanthropy. Aside from our National Philanthropy, we support various other charities and not-for-profit causes such as Breast Cancer Research, Make-A-Wish, Boys and Girls Club, Prevent Child Abuse Awareness, and many more. Other service events have benefited the campus and the surrounding communities. Some of these service opportunities are: Ronald McDonald House, St. Jude’s Children’s Hospital, Girl Scouts of America, Big Brothers and Big Sisters and Habitat for Humanity. The time spent together on these events is one of the many times that our fraternity brothers can bond, while making a difference in someone’s life.
      </p>

      <h5 class="text-left">
        How will joining a chapter now benefit me as a student after college?
      </h5>
      <p class="text-left">
        The life long friendships you will make through this associate chapter can last into post-college years. Membership in this associate chapter can be a life-long experience. Joining now is really an investment in your future. Wherever a member ends up after college, chances are he will be able to find an alumni chapter or other members of the fraternity in the area. In addition, Sigma Beta Rho has a national Alumni Association which provides a network for our members that could be helpful in finding jobs, internships, or simply professional/personal guidance.
      </p>

      <h5 class="text-left">
        What can I do as a parent or family member?
      </h5>
      <p class="text-left">
        Be supportive, and learn as much as you can by talking to your son before he joins. Our chapters provide rush packets and informationals; your son should be encouraged to obtain all provided documents and read the information as well as attend the events. In addition, allow your son to make their own choice (especially if you yourself were Greek). Your support should not end after the recruitment period but continue throughout your son’s years in school. Once your son joins a chapter, take advantage of the opportunities to attend public fraternity events such as your son’s probate show (introduction as a member of the fraternity). These are great opportunities for you to see your son interacting with his chapter members, and one more way for you to spend time with your son.
