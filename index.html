      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>
        Our pillars of Society, Brotherhood, and Remembrance were established upon the formation of the Alpha Chapter at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, on August 16, 1996. Our founders realized the unique promise of a Greek-lettered organization that instills positive values among its members, provides an avenue for leadership, and promotes self-betterment.
      </p>

      <p>
        In its nascent stages, these founders understood that they must maintain a constant and growing nationwide network in order to truly manifest their organizational vision. As such, several new brothers were inducted on August 22, 1998 in New York. At this time, eight men from three different universities were given the status of National Founding Fathers as they were the visionaries who established the Fraternity for years to come.
      </p>

      <p>
        Modern day Sigma Beta Rho has grown considerably since its inception. We have expanded from our roots on the East Coast to forty five recognized active chapters and colonies that span the breadth of the nation. This growth stems from a reputation for excellent, values-based programming, diversity among our brotherhood, and alignment with the ideals of many students who strive for a competitive edge before entering a post-globalized working world.
      </p>

      <p>
        As an organization that prides itself on having individuals from every continent, ethnicity, and religion, we seek to foster enriching, cross-cultural discourse both amongst our members and within our campus communities. Through the efforts of our brothers, we have become the largest, most expansive fraternity of our kind in seventeen years. With each passing day, we strive to take one more step towards realizing the nationwide network envisioned by our National Founding Fathers.This applies not just to accepting and celebrating the cultural, racial, sexual, and other differences that characterize our membership, but to an understanding of brotherhood beyond the ranks of our own organization – not just Greek unity, but humanity as a whole. This is imagined as an ideal for which we strive – to make a positive impact in and on the lives of others irrespective of difference.
      </p>

      <h1>Our Colony's History</h1>
      <p>
        The University of Michigan colony was founded in 2012. Thirteen men had a vision to expand Sigma Beta Rho Fraternity, Inc. to the Midwest Region. These men were given the status of Founding Fathers as they would establish the fraternity for years to come. More importantly, they were the foundation for expansion throughout the entire region.

        As a fraternity that strongly believes in giving back to our community through service, we have partnered with S.O.S Children’s Villages International as our national Philanthropy. Duty to one’s society is instilled in each of our members at induction and emphasized throughout his undergraduate years. This foundation has been working with disadvantaged families around the world from more than 133 different countries since 1960 in order to prevent crises that can lead to family separation. S.O.S Children’s Villages’ focus is on abandoned, destitute and orphaned children requiring family-based child care. Millions of children worldwide are living without the biological families therefore S.O.S. provides about 50,000 such children and 15,000 young adults with a permanent new family. Community service and campus involvement is a crucial component of our chapter evaluations.

          Brotherhood defines the bonds that hold our fraternity together. Through the development of close relationships within the ranks of our fraternity, brothers of Sigma Beta Rho know that they are creating relationships that will last them for a lifetime. Brothers from Sigma Beta Rho are dedicated to each other and are always finding ways to spend time together. On campus, brothers live together, take classes together, compete in intramural sports together and participate in a variety of extracurriculars together.

          Even after graduation, brothers find ways to stay involved. Through our Chapter’s alumni network and mentorship program, on-campus brothers have the opportunity to connect with those that have already graduated, creating relationships and expanding their personal networks. Alumni from our chapter have gone on to companies like Microsoft, Goldman Sachs, NASA, J.P Morgan Chase, graduate schools while some have started their own companies, even being named to Forbes 30 under 30 for their accomplishments in entrepreneurship. These are the members of our fraternity that are always looking for ways to give back.

          Our membership is comprised of individuals from all different nationalities, ethnicities, religions, and creeds. As a truly multicultural fraternity, we are committed to promoting diversity and cultural awareness on university campuses across the nation. It has been said that the best way to realize where you are going is knowing where you have come from, and that is why we are dedicated to showcasing the different cultures that each of our members bring. Given that many come from different backgrounds, not only is it necessary for an individual to recognize and appreciate his/her own culture, but also to be aware of and to appreciate other cultures. At its core, remembrance is about understanding and appreciating what others have done for the world and taking the initiative to leave your own mark, be it in terms of service, your achievements or the bonds that you form. Brothers work to empower each other to make these changes as strong and permanent as possible.
